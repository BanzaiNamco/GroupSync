Test case 1 - Starvation test
Expected - Instances all have similar or exactly the same amount of parties
served and finish time

max_number_of_instances=10
number_of_tanks=100
number_of_healers=100
number_of_dps=300
min_finish_time_seconds=1
max_finish_time_seconds=1

Test case 2 - Invalid t1,t2 (t1 > t2 || t1 == 0 || t2 == 0)
Expected - Exception thrown

max_number_of_instances=10
number_of_tanks=100
number_of_healers=100
number_of_dps=300
min_finish_time_seconds=3
max_finish_time_seconds=1

Test case 3 - Number parser check
Expected - All non number values are ignored and the rest are parsed correctly
Expected(1) - negative numbers are turned positive
Expected(2) - float values for non time values are truncated; time values are truncated after 3 decimals.

max_number_of_instances=1abc2
number_of_tanks=hsdf1
number_of_healers=,1
number_of_dps=-3
min_finish_time_seconds=1
max_finish_time_seconds=1.1234

Test case 4 - Simulation run
Expected - All instances have similar finish times and parties served

max_number_of_instances=20
number_of_tanks=234
number_of_healers=189
number_of_dps=18786
min_finish_time_seconds=1
max_finish_time_seconds=15

Test case 5 - Two instances, one party
Expected - One instance serves the party and the other instance is idle

max_number_of_instances=2
number_of_tanks=4
number_of_healers=1
number_of_dps=3
min_finish_time_seconds=1
max_finish_time_seconds=2
